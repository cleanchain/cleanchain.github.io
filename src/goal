# Transparency, efficiency and more <a href="https://www.cleanchain.org" title="cleanchain.org"><img align="right" src="docs/cleanchain.svg" width="37" /></a>

Blockchain will be the driving factor of the ten-years plan proposed by the European Commission *From Farm 2 Fork* that will guide us through the transition towards a fair, healthy and respectful food system.




## Italian models

In Italy we already have few entities that adopted this technology. For example in Campania *Flagchain* and *FLAG* have implemented a blockchain platform to enhance and promote the local fishing chain ecosystem. Meanwhile, last year in Sicily, the Region approved a law that regulate the use of blockchain to trace food farming products.




## What about the others?

In France Carrefour began its project 4 years ago. Starting from the poultry industry, using a blockchain based system, the retailer linked all the counterparts working in the production chain of the Arvernia chicken, giving the consumer excellent transparency on its product.




## What's the real deal?

We are certain that using a blockchain to implement a single utility is not worth the effort, especially in a well oiled machine as the food industry is. There's the need to couple this technology together with a vertical business solution to ensure efficiency and scalability.

> Our idea is a distributed network platform as base system for the food chain industry, where everyone can add services as modules, tailored to the specific needs of the user.




## Certifications and branding

Such a platform could be extended and used to create a brand too. Beneath a register symbol that represents a *Code of Conduct*, there would be gathered all the rules and regulations that ensure a clean and sustainable food production (together with all the european and national certifications already planned).

> The result would be unprecedented: a decentralized, distributed certification mechanism synonymous of safety and quality.




## Free as in freedom

As computer scientists, it is important for us to address the copyright issue. This project, however it will take form, should be published with a free licence so that every party involved could *share* and *adapt* the platform providing the community a better and more responsible service.
